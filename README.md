# Traffic_Sign_Recognition---using_CNN
This project proposes an innovative approach to address the challenges associated with accurate and efficient traffic sign recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The main objective of the Traffic Sign Recognition is to identify a traffic sign from a digital photograph. 
Traffic sign after identification should classify signs with high accuracy rate.
As the size of the static folder is greater than 25mb that's why I have zipped it; so while working with the project unzip it first.
